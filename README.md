# Youth Mappers Uganda
This is a union that unites all mapping chapters within Uganda.
As a union, we are to use this website to portray the activities that youth mappers are currently invovled in their chapters and also how to improve the mapping.
This website is also to be used as a forum for these youth mappers to get updated with mapping news, softwares and opportunities.
Thus the call for help to build a responsive and educative forum for all mappers around Uganda.

Thanks in Advance for your contributions to this project.
